/**Builder for a basic MC Entity class.  This builder allows us to create a new entity
 * class that we can control that doesn't have the wonky systems the MC entities have, such
 * as no roll axis, a single hitbox, and tons of immutable objects that get thrown away every update.
 * Constructor takes a class of {@link AEntityBase}} to construct, but NOT an instance.  This is because
 * we can't create our entity instance at the same time MC creates its instance as we might not yet have NBT
 * data.  Instead, we simply hold on to the class and construct it whenever we get called to do so.
